P: We're almost there. Ready, MC?

MC: Sure. Remind me again why we're doing this?

P: We're clearing an abandoned laboratory. Experiment went wrong, and now the place is crawling with zombies. 

MC: Risky.

P: That's why we're paid well. We got a fat reward waiting for us after beating them all.

MC: Sounds great. How will we beat them?

P: Your abilites are represented as cards. After confronting an enemy, you'll have the chance to choose what cards to battle them with.

MC: What do the cards do?

P: Your abilites are varied. You can damage the enemy, heal yourself, collect energy, and do so much more.

MC: Okay. What's the bare minimum that I need to know?

P: Each card you hold requires one energy to play. Energy is gained only by playing cards that give you energy.

MC: So if my card says, <Energy + 1>, I'll gain 1 energy?

P: That's right.

MC: And every time a card is used, one energy point is depleted?

P: Right again.

MC: I get it. And if I don't have any energy points, I can't play any cards.

P: Exactly.

MC: How exactly do I fight enemies with these cards?

P: After you select the cards you want to take into battle, you'll just move without thinking.

MC: So I'll just watch myself and the enemy battle it out?

P: Yeah, something like that.

MC: You mentioned that I could do so much with these cards. So there's even more to learn?

P: Don't worry, you know all the basics now. You'll pick up the rest as you go.

MC: Okay. Then let's go.

P: WAIT! One more thing. Have you read the tutorial from the menu screen?

MC: The what?

P: There's a detailed guide on how this game's battle system works in the tutorial section of the main menu.

MC: That sounds very useful. I'll be sure to take a look at it if I have any questions.
