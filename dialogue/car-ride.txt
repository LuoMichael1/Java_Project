P: We're almost there. Ready, MC?

MC: Sure. Remind me again why we're doing this?

P: We're stealing from CyberCorp. They have a secret project. Worth a fortune.

MC: Risky.

P: That's why we're paid well.

MC: Who's the boss?

P: The Director. Mysterious, powerful, and dangerous. No one knows their real name, face, or gender. They're like a ghost.

MC: Well, what do you know?

P: I did some digging. Look here.

MC: Impressive.

P: And scary.

MC: How do we stand a chance?

P: You're the world's best hacker and infiltrator. I'm your capable and genius partner. There's nothing we can't do.

MC: You're also loud, nosy, and annoying.

P: Hey, that's not nice.

MC: But true.

P: Fine.. want to play a game?

MC: A game?

P: A card game. A holographic card game. Simulates a mock battle between us.

MC: How does it work?

P: We have cards. Represent our moves, abilities, gadgets, etc. We take turns playing cards. Try to reduce each other's health points to zero. Cards have effects and costs. We have to manage our resources and use our cards wisely. Game ends when one of us runs out of health points, or when timer runs out.

MC: Why play?

P: It's fun. It's practice. It's challenge.

MC: I see.

P: Do you want to play?

MC: Sure.

P: Great. Let the game begin.

MC: P... You...

P: Get wrecked, scrub.

MC: I swear I'm gonna-

P: Look! We're almost there!

MC: Sigh. That's it, huh? The enemy's base.

P: Yep.

MC: Can we do this?

P: Of course we can, MC. We're a team, remember? We have each other's back. We have the skills, the tools, and the guts. We have nothing to fear.

MC: Nothing?

P: Well, maybe one thing.

MC: What?

P: The parking. It's a nightmare.

MC: ...

P: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Relax, MC. It's a joke.

MC: Not funny.

P: Come on, MC. Smile. It's not the end of the world.

MC: Not yet.

P: Exactly. So let's make sure it doesn't happen. Let's go in there and do our job. Let's show The Director who they're messing with.

MC: Let's do it.

P: Alright. Here we go.
